  abstract = {Heart disease, one of the main reasons behind the high mortality rate around the world, requires a sophisticated and expensive diagnosis process. In the recent past, much literature has demonstrated machine learning approaches as an opportunity to efficiently diagnose heart disease patients. However, challenges associated with datasets such as missing data, inconsistent data, and mixed data (containing inconsistent missing data both as numerical and categorical) are often obstacles in medical diagnosis. This inconsistency led to a higher probability of misprediction and a misled result. Data preprocessing steps like feature reduction, data conversion, and data scaling are employed to form a standard dataset---such measures play a crucial role in reducing inaccuracy in final prediction. This paper aims to evaluate eleven machine learning (ML) algorithms---Logistic Regression (LR), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost (XGB), Random Forest Classifier (RF), Gradient Boost (GB), AdaBoost (AB), Extra Tree Classifier (ET)---and six different data scaling methods---Normalization (NR), Standscale (SS), MinMax (MM), MaxAbs (MA), Robust Scaler (RS), and Quantile Transformer (QT) on a dataset comprising of information of patients with heart disease. The result shows that CART, along with RS or QT, outperforms all other ML algorithms with 100\% accuracy, 100\% precision, 99\% recall, and 100\% F1 score. The study outcomes demonstrate that the model's performance varies depending on the data scaling method.},

We demonstrate the use of Bayesian Hidden Physics Models to first uncover the physics governing the propagation of acoustic impulses in metallic specimens using data obtained from a pristine sample. We then use the learned physics to characterize the microstructure of a separate specimen with a surface-breaking crack flaw. Remarkably, we find that the physics learned from the first specimen allows us to understand the backscattering observed in the latter sample, a qualitative feature that is wholly absent from the specimen from which the physics were inferred. The backscattering is explained through inhomogeneities of a latent spatial field that can be recognized as the speed of sound in the media.},

This article presents a novel approach to object detection in industrial or general ultrasound tomography. The key idea is to analyze the time-dependent ultrasonic signal recorded by three independent transducers of an experimental system. It focuses on finding common or related characteristics of these signals using custom-designed deep neural network models. In principle, models use convolution layers to extract common features of signals, which are passed to dense layers responsible for predicting the number of objects or their locations and sizes. Predicting the number and properties of objects are characterized by a high value of the coefficient of determination               R               2               = 99.8\% and               R               2               = 98.4\%, respectively. The proposed solution can result in a reliable and low-cost method of object detection for various industry sectors.},

  abstract = {Two powerful formulas have been available to scientists for more than two centuries: Newton's second law, providing a foundation for classical physics, and Bayes's theorem, prescribing probabilistic learning about unknown quantities based on observations. For the most part the use of these formulas has been separated, with Newton being the more dominant in geophysics. This separation is arguably surprising since numerous sources of uncertainty arise in the application of classical physics in complex situations. One explanation for the separation is the difficulty in implementing Bayesian analysis in complex settings. However, recent advances in both modeling strategies and computational tools have contributed to a significant change in the scope and feasibility of Bayesian analysis. This paradigm provides opportunities for the combination of physical reasoning and observational data in a coherent analysis framework but in a fashion which manages the uncertainties in both information sources. A key to the modeling is the hierarchical viewpoint, in which separate statistical models are developed for the process variables studied and for the observations conditional on those variables. Modeling process variables in this way enables the incorporation of physics across a spectrum of levels of intensity, ranging from a qualitative use of physical reasoning to a strong reliance on numerical models. Selected examples from this spectrum are reviewed.                                So far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain. And so far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.Albert Einstein (1921)},

These systematics arise from (i) how one normalizes the spectra when stacking; (ii) having to subtract emission before estimating absorption line strengths; (iii) the decision to fit the whole spectrum or just a few absorption lines; (iv) SSP model differences (e.g. isochrones, enrichment, IMF). The MILES+Padova SSP models, fit to the H{$\beta$}, \textlangle Fe\textrangle, TiO2SDSS, and [MgFe] Lick indices in the stacks, indicate that out to the half-light radius Re: (a) ages are younger and [{$\alpha$}/Fe] values are lower in the central regions but the opposite is true of [M/H]; (b) the IMF is more bottom-heavy in the center, but is close to Kroupa beyond about Re/2; (c) this makes M*/L about 2~\texttimes{} larger in the central regions than beyond Re/2. While the models of Conroy et~al. return similar [M/H] and [{$\alpha$}/Fe] profiles, the age and (hence) M*/L profiles can differ significantly even for solar abundances and a Kroupa IMF; different responses to non-solar abundances and IMF parametrization further compound these differences. There are clear (model independent) differences between E-SRs, E-FRs, and S0s: younger ages and less enhanced [{$\alpha$}/Fe] values suggest that E-FRs and S0s are not SSPs, but relaxing this assumption is unlikely to change their inferred M*/L gradients significantly.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Weather forecasting is important for science and society. At present, the most accurate forecast system is the numerical weather prediction (NWP) method, which represents atmospheric states as discretized grids and numerically solves partial differential equations that describe the transition between those states               1               . However, this procedure is computationally expensive. Recently, artificial-intelligence-based methods               2               have shown potential in accelerating weather forecasting by orders of magnitude, but the forecast accuracy is still significantly lower than that of NWP methods. Here we introduce an artificial-intelligence-based method for accurate, medium-range global weather forecasting. We show that three-dimensional deep networks equipped with Earth-specific priors are effective at dealing with complex patterns in weather data, and that a hierarchical temporal aggregation strategy reduces accumulation errors in medium-range forecasting. Trained on 39\,years of global data, our program, Pangu-Weather, obtains stronger deterministic forecast results on reanalysis data in all tested variables when compared with the world's best NWP system, the operational integrated forecasting system of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)               3               . Our method also works well with extreme weather forecasts and ensemble forecasts. When initialized with reanalysis data, the accuracy of tracking tropical cyclones is also higher than that of ECMWF-HRES.},

  abstract = {{$<$}strong{$>$}Dataset corresponding to the Seismic waveform tomography of the Central and Eastern Mediterranean upper mantle{$<$}/strong{$>$} This dataset belongs to the seismic waveform tomography of the Central and Eastern Mediterranean by Blom, Gokhberg and Fichtner, Solid Earth (Discussions), 2019. Seismic tomography is an inverse problem where the internal elastic structure of the Earth (the upper \textasciitilde 500 km) is determined from seismograms (the vibrations of the Earth as a result of earthquakes, as recorded by seismometers at the Earth's surface). This inverse problem is cast as an optimisation where the misfit between observed and synthetic seismograms is minimised: waveform tomography (often referred to as full waveform inversion or FWI). Synthetic seismograms are produced by simulating the elastic wavefield of earthquakes within the Earth. The optimisation problem is solved by iterative, deterministic, gradient-based inversion. Gradients are computed using the adjoint method, which requires one forward wavefield simulation and one adjoint wavefield simulation per earthquake used in the project. The inversion was carried out over several frequency bands, starting with the longest periods and including a progressively broader frequency band. Within each frequency band, \textasciitilde 10-20 iterations were carried out, totalling to a hundred iterations. Synthetic seismograms and iteration information are stored for a subset of iterations, notably those where human interaction (i.e. the selection of events / data windows) took place. Here, we describe: The contents of this package How to set up the package such that all the data can be accessed and used, and reproduce the figures. {$<$}strong{$>$}Contents of this package{$<$}/strong{$>$} Data that was used for the seismic waveform inversion: raw and processed seismograms, station information, earthquake information, as well as the window selection (designating the parts of the data that were actually used at each stage in the inversion) and synthetic seismograms produced during various stages of the inversion. This information is gathered in the LASIF project "EMed\_full.complete.tar". Models and misfit development across the iterations, as well as models relating to model testing, as carried out after the inversion. This information is gathered in the tarball "MODEL\_FILES.tar". Model files are both given in the ses3d ascii format (text file drho, dvsv, dvsh, dvp and block\_x, block\_y, block\_z) and in bundled .vtu format. Conversion to .vtu was done using the tools in SCRIPTS. These vtu files can be viewed using Paraview. information on the tools and code that was used to do the inversion: ses3d: a seismic wave propagation spectral element code in spherical coordinates. This will run both forward and adjoint simulations. This is available publicly through the developers on https://cos.ethz.ch/software/production/ses3d.html. See Gokhberg \&amp; Fichtner, 2016. LASIF: a waveform inversion workflow managing package, where we have made small adaptations to make it suitable for our workflow. The original package is available via www.lasif.net and on github (see Krischer et al, 2015), the modified version is added to this package as 'LASIF-master.zip'. LASIF\_scripts: bespoke scripts in order to interact with the LASIF project and generate different types of analyses and plots that are used in the publication. This is included in the tarball 'LASIF\_scripts.tar' SCRIPTS: containing some modified tools that were originally written for ses3d, as well as some additional tools - notably to interact with models converted to the VTK format. This is included in the tarball 'SCRIPTS.tar' A description of the conda environment named lasif\_ext (which is used for all the data analysis), in the form of the yml file 'lasif\_ext.yml' An additional LASIF project which is used just to compute sensitivity kernels for different windows within the same trace: 'EMed\_window\_kernels.tar'. This is used as an example in one of the manuscript figures. {$<$}strong{$>$}How to set up the data package{$<$}/strong{$>$} Download the entire data package. We will assume it is located in `\textasciitilde/Downloads/`. Get miniconda or anaconda if you don't have it. Install LASIF. This can be done using the instructions from the LASIF website, but with a few adaptations, which are detailed in the lasif\_ext.yml file. This amounts to the following: Add the channel conda-forge to your standard channels Name the environment "lasif\_ext" Manually replace the files in the LASIF source directory with those in LASIF-master.zip. Install the specific version of pyqt=4.11. Install the additional packages jupyter, vtk=7.0.0, pandas=0.23.4 (these are the ones that work for me). Extract the LASIF\_scripts.tar to the site-packages directory of your conda environment: &lt;code class="language-bash"&gt;tar -xf ~/Downloads/LASIF_scripts.tar -C [/path/to/conda/environments]/lasif_ext/lib/python2.7/site-packages/&lt;/code&gt; Make a project directory and extract all needed packages into it: &lt;code class="language-bash"&gt;# make project directory mkdir CEMed_project_Blometal cd CEMed_project_Blometal # extract data tarballs into it tar -xf ~/Downloads/EMed_full.complete.tar tar -xf ~/Downloads/EMed_window_kernels.tar tar -xf ~/Downloads/MODEL_FILES.tar # make scripts directory and extract scripts into it mkdir conda_stuff tar -xf ~/Downloads/SCRIPTS.tar -C conda_stuff # make data analysis directory mkdir data_analysis cd data_analysis # extract analysis tools tar -xf ~/Downloads/NPY_FILES.tar tar -xf ~/Downloads/FIGURE_SCRIPTS.tar tar -xf ~/Downloads/figs_png.tar&lt;/code&gt; Now the project should be ready for inspection. The following things can be done, for example: Reproduce the figures in the manuscript. All scripts for this are located in CEMed\_project\_Blometal/data\_analysis/FIGURE\_SCRIPTS/. &lt;code class="language-bash"&gt;conda activate lasif_ext cd CEMed_project_Blometal jupyter notebook&lt;/code&gt; This should open up a browser tab that shows the directory structure. Navigate to data\_analysis/FIGURE\_scripts and click on one of the .ipynb files to open it. If you press 'Kernel' \&gt; 'Restart kernel and run all' at the top, all cells will be launched automatically. This should work out of the box. Interact with the lasif project. For this, refer to the LASIF website. Note that above jupyter notebooks do so extensively, using the lasif communicator. Build additional analysis tools, using the tools supplied in SCRIPTS and LASIF\_scripts. {$<$}strong{$>$}References:{$<$}/strong{$>$} Blom, N., Gokhberg, A., and Fichtner, A.: {$<$}strong{$>$}Seismic waveform tomography of the Central and Eastern Mediterranean upper mantle{$<$}/strong{$>$}, Solid Earth Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/se-2019-152, in review, 2019.

  abstract = {Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have proven to be an efficient and effective method for resolution-independent operator learning in a broad variety of application areas across scientific machine learning. A key reason for their success is their ability to accurately model long-range dependencies in spatio-temporal data by learning global convolutions in a computationally efficient manner. To this end, FNOs rely on the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), however, DFTs cause visual and spectral artifacts as well as pronounced dissipation when learning operators in spherical coordinates by incorrectly assuming flat geometry. To overcome this limitation, we generalize FNOs on the sphere, introducing Spherical FNOs (SFNOs) for learning operators on spherical geometries. We apply SFNOs to forecasting atmo- spheric dynamics, and demonstrate stable autoregressive rollouts for a year of simulated time (1,460 steps), while retaining physically plausible dynamics. The SFNO has important implications for machine learning-based simulation of climate dynamics that could eventually help accelerate our response to climate change.}

  abstract = {We address the challenge of acoustic simulations in three-dimensional (3D) virtual rooms with parametric source positions, which have applications in virtual/augmented reality, game audio, and spatial computing. The wave equation can fully describe wave phenomena such as diffraction and interference. However, conventional numerical discretization methods are computationally expensive when simulating hundreds of source and receiver positions, making simulations with parametric source positions impractical. To overcome this limitation, we propose using deep operator networks to approximate linear wave-equation operators. This enables the rapid prediction of sound propagation in realistic 3D acoustic scenes with parametric source positions, achieving millisecond-scale computations. By learning a compact surrogate model, we avoid the offline calculation and storage of impulse responses for all relevant source/listener pairs. Our experiments, including various complex scene geometries, show good agreement with reference solutions, with root mean squared errors ranging from 0.02 to 0.10 Pa. Notably, our method signifies a paradigm shift as---to our knowledge---no prior machine learning approach has achieved precise predictions of complete wave fields within realistic domains.},

  abstract = {Aim/Purpose: The aim of this study was to analyze various performance metrics and approaches to their classification. The main goal of the study was to develop a new typology that will help to advance knowledge of metrics and facilitate their use in machine learning regression algorithms Background: Performance metrics (error measures) are vital components of the evaluation frameworks in various fields. A performance metric can be defined as a logical and mathematical construct designed to measure how close are the actual results from what has been expected or predicted. A vast variety of performance metrics have been described in academic literature. The most commonly mentioned metrics in research studies are Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), etc. Knowledge about metrics properties needs to be systematized to simplify the design and use of the metrics. Methodology: A qualitative study was conducted to achieve the objectives of identifying related peer-reviewed research studies, literature reviews, critical thinking and inductive reasoning. Contribution: The main contribution of this paper is in ordering knowledge of performance metrics and enhancing understanding of their structure and properties by proposing a new typology, generic primary metrics mathematical formula and a visualization chart Findings: Based on the analysis of the structure of numerous performance metrics, we proposed a framework of metrics which includes four (4) categories: primary metrics, extended metrics, composite metrics, and hybrid sets of metrics. The paper identified three (3) key components (dimensions) that determine the structure and properties of primary metrics: method of determining point distance, method of normalization, method of aggregation of point distances over a data set. For each component, implementation options have been identified. The suggested new typology has been shown to cover a total of over 40 commonly used primary metrics Recommendations for Practitioners: Presented findings can be used to facilitate teaching performance metrics to university students and expedite metrics selection and implementation processes for practitioners Recommendation for Researchers: By using the proposed typology, researchers can streamline development of new metrics with predetermined properties Impact on Society: The outcomes of this study could be used for improving evaluation results in machine learning regression, forecasting and prognostics with direct or indirect positive impacts on innovation and productivity in a societal sense Future Research: Future research is needed to examine the properties of the extended metrics, composite metrics, and hybrid sets of metrics. Empirical study of the metrics is needed using R Studio or Azure Machine Learning Studio, to find associations between the properties of primary metrics and their ``numerical'' behavior in a wide spectrum of data characteristics and business or research requirements},

This has occurred through a series of publications from innovators, which have rapidly improved deterministic forecast skill. Our own evaluation confirms that these forecasts have comparable deterministic skill to NWP models across a range of variables. However, on medium-range timescales probabilistic forecasting, typically achieved through ensembles, is key for providing actionable insights to users. ECMWF is building on top of these recent works to develop a probabilistic forecasting system, AIFS. We will showcase results from our progress towards this system and outline our roadmap to operationalisation.}

  abstract = {Significance             Understanding dynamic constraints and balances in nature has facilitated rapid development of knowledge and enabled technology, including aircraft, combustion engines, satellites, and electrical power. This work develops a novel framework to discover governing equations underlying a dynamical system simply from data measurements, leveraging advances in sparsity techniques and machine learning. The resulting models are parsimonious, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability while avoiding overfitting. There are many critical data-driven problems, such as understanding cognition from neural recordings, inferring climate patterns, determining stability of financial markets, predicting and suppressing the spread of disease, and controlling turbulence for greener transportation and energy. With abundant data and elusive laws, data-driven discovery of dynamics will continue to play an important role in these efforts.           ,              Extracting governing equations from data is a central challenge in many diverse areas of science and engineering. Data are abundant whereas models often remain elusive, as in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, and epidemiology, to name only a few examples. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing equations from noisy measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems in an appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. This results in parsimonious models that balance accuracy with model complexity to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized systems and systems that are time-varying or have external forcing.},

  abstract = {The {$\nu$}-support vector machine ({$\nu$}-SVM) for classification proposed by Sch\"olkopf, Smola, Williamson, and Bartlett (2000) has the advantage of using a parameter {$\nu$} on controlling the number of support vectors. In this article, we investigate the relation between {$\nu$}-SVM and C-SVM in detail. We show that in general they are two different problems with the same optimal solution set. Hence, we may expect that many numerical aspects of solving them are similar. However, compared to regular C-SVM, the formulation of {$\nu$}-SVM is more complicated, so up to now there have been no effective methods for solving large-scale {$\nu$}-SVM. We propose a decomposition method for {$\nu$}-SVM that is competitive with existing methods for C-SVM. We also discuss the behavior of {$\nu$}-SVM by some numerical experiments.},

  abstract = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved promising performance on a wide range of graph-based tasks. Despite their success, one severe limitation of GNNs is the over-smoothing issue (indistinguishable representations of nodes in different classes). In this work, we present a systematic and quantitative study on the over-smoothing issue of GNNs. First, we introduce two quantitative metrics, MAD and MADGap, to measure the smoothness and over-smoothness of the graph nodes representations, respectively. Then, we verify that smoothing is the nature of GNNs and the critical factor leading to over-smoothness is the low information-to-noise ratio of the message received by the nodes, which is partially determined by the graph topology. Finally, we propose two methods to alleviate the over-smoothing issue from the topological view: (1) MADReg which adds a MADGap-based regularizer to the training objective; (2) AdaEdge which optimizes the graph topology based on the model predictions. Extensive experiments on 7 widely-used graph datasets with 10 typical GNN models show that the two proposed methods are effective for relieving the over-smoothing issue, thus improving the performance of various GNN models.}

This work aimed at assessing the interrelation between EWE and agriculture through a systematic quantitative review of current scientific literature. The review analysed 19 major cropping systems (cereals, legumes, viticulture, horticulture and pastures) across five continents. Documents were extracted from the Scopus database and examined with a text mining tool to appraise the trend of publications across the years, the specific EWE-related issues examined and the research gaps addressed. The results highlighted that food security and economic losses due to the EWE represent a major interest of the scientific community. Implementation of remote sensing and imagery techniques for monitoring and detecting the effects of EWE is still underdeveloped. Large research gaps still lie in the areas concerning the effects of EWE on major cash crops (grapevine and tomato) and the agronomic dynamics of EWE in developing countries. Current knowledge on the physiological dynamics regulating the responses of main crops to EWE appears to be well established, while more research is urgently needed in the fields of mitigation measures and governance systems.},

In this paper, we apply Neural operator learning to the time-of-flight ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) problem. We learn the mapping between time-of-flight (TOF) data and the heterogeneous sound speed field using a full-wave solver to generate the training data. This novel application of operator learning circumnavigates the need to solve the computationally intensive iterative inverse problem. The operator learns the non-linear mapping offline and predicts the heterogeneous sound field with a single forward pass through the model. This is the first time operator learning has been used for ultrasound tomography and is the first step in potential real-time predictions of soft tissue distribution for tumor identification in beast imaging.},

  abstract = {The term `surrogate modeling' in computational science and engineering refers to the development of computationally efficient approximations for expensive simulations, such as those arising from numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). Surrogate modeling is an enabling methodology for many-query computations in science and engineering, which include iterative methods in optimization and sampling methods in uncertainty quantification. Over the last few years, several approaches to surrogate modeling for PDEs using neural networks have emerged, motivated by successes in using neural networks to approximate nonlinear maps in other areas. In principle, the relative merits of these different approaches can be evaluated by understanding, for each one, the cost required to achieve a given level of accuracy. However, the absence of a complete theory of approximation error for these approaches makes it difficult to assess this cost-accuracy trade-off. The purpose of the paper is to provide a careful numerical study of this issue, comparing a variety of different neural network architectures for operator approximation across a range of problems arising from PDE models in continuum mechanics.},

  abstract = {Structural defect detection is an important problem in civil engineering. Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) recently has been further developed to address this problem by emitting waves to the building attached with sensors and reconstructing sensor signals-much like a CT scan. However, decoding the defects from sensor signals is much time consuming and mathematically impossible, since the corresponding inverse problems are difficult to solve and usually are ill-posed in real engineering applications. To solve these issues, data-driven approaches from deep learning have been investigated by researchers. Data-driven surrogate models like DeepONets, Fourier Neural Operators, and PINNs show strong strengths in computational efficiency than the classical wave equation solvers. Additionally, a well-designed regularization network is also able to address the ill-posedness of wave inversion. Thus, it will be promising to solve the wave equation by combining the surrogate models and different Machine Learning approaches. In this master thesis, we focus on applying DeepONets architecture to wave equations and analyzing the results acquired by it. Initially, various information about wave equations and traditional solvers is introduced. Moreover, we get our data from simulations executed at high-capacity GPU servers. Different DeepONets architectures (Stacked and Unstacked) with various subnetworks (FCNN, CNN) are afterwards implemented to solve the equation. In the end, each approach is evaluated and subsequently, the best one is emphasized.}

The motivation beyond the use of this imaging technique lies in the possibility of obtaining quantitative imaging which is also operator-independent, conversely to conventional approaches. Thus, the need for public data sets for testing inverse scattering approaches is always persisting. To this aim, this paper introduces an experimental multiple-input-multiple-output ultrasound tomographic database whose acquisitions were performed by an air-matched in-house system designed and built by the Authors. The proposed database provides several cases with single and multiple objects of different shapes, sizes, and materials, to be imaged in laboratory-controlled conditions. Therefore, these scenarios can represent interesting options for the preliminary testing of tomographic ultrasound imaging approaches.},

Here we describe the application to global weather systems of a novel computational method called the Entropy Field Decomposition (EFD) capable of efficiently characterizing coherent spatiotemporal structures in non-linear multivariate interacting physical systems. Using the EFD derived system configurations, we demonstrate the application of a second novel computational method called Space-Time Information Trajectories (STITs) that reveal how spatiotemporal coherences are dynamically connected. The method is demonstrated on the specific phenomenon known as atmospheric rivers (ARs) which are a prime example of a highly coherent, in both space and time, severe weather phenomenon whose generation and persistence are influenced by weather dynamics on a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. The EFD reveals how the interacting wind vector field and humidity scalar field couple to produce ARs, while the resulting STITS reveal the linkage between ARs and large-scale planetary circulations. The focus on ARs is also motivated by their devastating social and economic effects that have made them the subject of increasing scientific investigation to which the EFD may offer new insights. The application of EFD and STITs to the broader range of severe weather events is discussed.},

  abstract = {Abstract Non-linear Error Compensation Technique with Associative Restoration (NECTAR) is a novel approach to the assimilation of fragmentary sensor data to produce a global nowcast of the near-Earth space weather. NECTAR restores missing information by iteratively transforming (``morphing'') an underlying global climatology model into agreement with currently available sensor data. The morphing procedure benefits from analysis of the inherent multiscale diurnal periodicity of the geosystems by processing 24-hr time histories of the differences between measured and climate-expected values at each sensor site. The 24-hr deviation time series are used to compute and then globally interpolate the diurnal deviation harmonics. NECTAR therefore views the geosystem in terms of its periodic planetary-scale basis to associate observed fragments of the activity with the grand-scale weather processes of the matching variability scales. Such approach strengthens the restorative capability of the assimilation, specifically when only a limited number of observatories is available for the weather nowcast. Scenarios where the NECTAR concept works best are common in planetary-scale near-Earth weather applications, especially where sensor instrumentation is complex, expensive, and therefore scarce. To conduct the assimilation process, NECTAR employs a Hopfield feedback recurrent neural network commonly used in the associative memory architectures. Associative memories mimic human capability to restore full information from its initial fragments. When applied to the sparse spatial data, such a neural network becomes a nonlinear multiscale interpolator of missing information. Early tests of the NECTAR morphing reveal its enhanced capability to predict system dynamics over no-data regions (spatial interpolation).},

A particular focus is set on crowd dynamics characterized by complex interactions among agents, also called social interactions, and large-scale systems. Specifically, in a crowd each individual agent interacts with a field generated by the other agents and the environment. These systems can be modeled at the microscopic scale by ordinary differential equations, while an alternative description at the mesoscopic scale is given by a partial differential equation for the propagation of the probability density of the agents. Control actions can be applied at the individual level as well as at the level of the corresponding fields. This article presents and compares different control types, and the specific application to multilane, multiclass traffic is developed in some detail, showing the main tools at work in a hybrid setting with relevant impacts on autonomous driving.},

We perform an analytic analysis based on the study of Lie symmetries for this system of equations, concentrating our attention on the traveling wave case. We then consider mappings of the resulting reductions onto equations defining elliptic functions, and special cases thereof, for example, solvable in terms of hyperbolic functions. In this way, we construct exact solutions of the system of partial differential equations under consideration. We believe this to be the first analytic study of this particular mathematical model.},

Seven studies show that the relationship between weather conditions and hedonic consumption (food and nonfood items) is differentially mediated by affect for women and men. The studies achieve triangulation by using diverse methodologies (census data, surveys, and experiments), participants (students and nonstudents), measures of independent variables (weather conditions as measured and manipulated), dependent measures (consumption preference and choice), and consumption modalities (food and nonfood).},

  abstract = {Partial differential equations play a fundamental role in the mathematical modelling of many processes and systems in physical, biological and other sciences. To simulate such processes and systems, the solutions of PDEs often need to be approximated numerically. The finite element method, for instance, is a usual standard methodology to do so. The recent success of deep neural networks at various approximation tasks has motivated their use in the numerical solution of PDEs. These so-called physics-informed neural networks and their variants have shown to be able to successfully approximate a large range of partial differential equations. So far, physics-informed neural networks and the finite element method have mainly been studied in isolation of each other. In this work, we compare the methodologies in a systematic computational study. Indeed, we employ both methods to numerically solve various linear and nonlinear partial differential equations: Poisson in 1D, 2D, and 3D, Allen-Cahn in 1D, semilinear Schr\textbackslash "odinger in 1D and 2D. We then compare computational costs and approximation accuracies. In terms of solution time and accuracy, physics-informed neural networks have not been able to outperform the finite element method in our study. In some experiments, they were faster at evaluating the solved PDE.},

A seven-point list of requirements for weather files is introduced and the state-of-the-art compared to this via a mapping exercise. It is found that there are various issues with all current and suggested approaches, but the two areas most requiring attention are the production of weather files for the urban landscape and files specifically designed to test buildings against the criteria of morbidity, mortality and building services system failure.             Practical application: Robust weather files are key to the design of sustainable, healthy and comfortable buildings.

While there has been an explosion of theoretical advances in partial differential equation models in the past two decades, this work has been generally neglected in mathematical ecology textbooks. Our goal in this paper is to make this literature accessible to experimentally ecologists. Partial differential equations are used to model a variety of ecological phenomena; here we discuss dispersal, ecological invasions, critical patch size, dispersal---mediated coexistence, and diffusion---driven spatial patterning. These model emphasize that simple organism movement can produce striking large---scale patterns in homogeneous environments, and that in heterogeneous environments, movement of multiple species can change the outcome of competition or predation.},

  abstract = {Abstract             NOAA global surface temperature (NOAAGlobalTemp) is NOAA's operational global surface temperature product, which has been widely used in Earth's climate assessment and monitoring. To improve the spatial interpolation of monthly land surface air temperatures (LSATs) in NOAAGlobalTemp from 1850 to 2020, a three-layer artificial neural network (ANN) system was designed. The ANN system was trained by repeatedly randomly selecting 90\% of the LSATs from ERA5 (1950--2019) and validating with the remaining 10\%. Validations show clear improvements of ANN over the original empirical orthogonal teleconnection (EOT) method: the global spatial correlation coefficient (SCC) increases from 65\% to 80\%, and the global root-mean-square difference (RMSD) decreases from 0.99{$^\circ$} to 0.57{$^\circ$}C during 1850--2020. The improvements of SCCs and RMSDs are larger in the Southern Hemisphere than in the Northern Hemisphere and are larger before the 1950s and where observations are sparse. The ANN system was finally fed in observed LSATs, and its output over the global land surface was compared with those from the EOT method. Comparisons demonstrate similar improvements by ANN over the EOT method: The global SCC increased from 78\% to 89\%, the global RMSD decreased from 0.93{$^\circ$} to 0.68{$^\circ$}C, and the LSAT variability quantified by the monthly standard deviation (STD) increases from 1.16{$^\circ$} to 1.41{$^\circ$}C during 1850--2020. While the SCC, RMSD, and STD at the monthly time scale have been improved, long-term trends remain largely unchanged because the low-frequency component of LSAT in ANN is identical to that in the EOT approach.                            Significance Statement               The spatial interpolation method of an artificial neural network has greatly improved the accuracy of land surface air temperature reconstruction, which reduces root-mean-square error and increases spatial coherence and variabilities over the global land surface from 1850 to 2020.}

Though the inverse problem under consideration is ill-posed by being unstable to noise in the input data, it has a unique solution. The Crank--Nicolson-finite difference method (CN-FDM) along with the Tikhonov regularization (TR) is applied for calculating an accurate and stable numerical solution. The programming language MATLAB built-in               lsqnonlin               is used to solve the obtained nonlinear minimization problem. The simulated noisy input data can be inverted by both analytical and numerically simulated. The obtained results show that they are accurate and stable.

  abstract = {Abstract             Natural materials typically exhibit irregular and non-periodic architectures, endowing them with compelling functionalities such as body protection, camouflage, and mechanical stress modulation. Among these functionalities, mechanical stress modulation is crucial for homeostasis regulation and tissue remodeling. Here, we uncover the relationship between stress modulation functionality and the irregularity of bio-inspired architected materials by a generative computational framework. This framework optimizes the spatial distribution of a limited set of basic building blocks and uses these blocks to assemble irregular materials with heterogeneous, disordered microstructures. Despite being irregular and non-periodic, the assembled materials display spatially varying properties that precisely modulate stress distribution towards target values in various control regions and load cases, echoing the robust stress modulation capability of natural materials. The performance of the generated irregular architected materials is experimentally validated with 3D printed physical samples --- a good agreement with target stress distribution is observed. Owing to its capability to redirect loads while keeping a proper amount of stress to stimulate bone repair, we demonstrate the potential application of the stress-programmable architected materials as support in orthopedic femur restoration.},

However, the non-linearity and complexity of changes in urban elements have brought great challenges to understanding this process. In this paper, we propose a cross-diffusion partial differential equation based on ecological dynamics to simulate the evolutionary process of urban elements from the microscopic viewpoint. The interaction between urban elements is simulated by constructing a non-linear and spatiotemporal change equation, and the main influence between elements is evaluated by the key parameters in the discussed equation. Our model is first experimented to time-series data on population density and housing prices to analyzes the interaction of these two elements in the evolution process. We then extend the model to label data, land cover data, to obtain a quantitative expression of the interaction between different land types in the process of urban land cover change.},

  abstract = {Deemed ``one of the top ten data mining mistakes'', leakage is the introduction of information about the data mining target that should not be legitimately available to mine from. In addition to our own industry experience with real-life projects, controversies around several major public data mining competitions held recently such as the INFORMS 2010 Data Mining Challenge and the IJCNN 2011 Social Network Challenge are evidence that this issue is as relevant today as it has ever been. While acknowledging the importance and prevalence of leakage in both synthetic competitions and real-life data mining projects, existing literature has largely left this idea unexplored. What little has been said turns out not to be broad enough to cover more complex cases of leakage, such as those where the classical independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumption is violated, that have been recently documented. In our new approach, these cases and others are explained by explicitly defining modeling goals and analyzing the broader framework of the data mining problem. The resulting definition enables us to derive general methodology for dealing with the issue. We show that it is possible to avoid leakage with a simple specific approach to data management followed by what we call a learn-predict separation, and present several ways of detecting leakage when the modeler has no control over how the data have been collected. We also offer an alternative point of view on leakage that is based on causal graph modeling concepts.},

  abstract = {In some real applications, only limited labeled positive examples and many unlabeled examples are available, but there are no negative examples. Such learning is termed as positive and unlabeled (PU) learning. PU learning algorithm has been studied extensively in recent years. However, the classical ones based on the Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are assumed that labeled positive data is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) and the sample size is large enough. It leads to two obvious shortcomings. On the one hand, the performance is not satisfactory, especially when the number of the labeled positive examples is small. On the other hand, classification results are not optimistic when datasets are Non-i.i.d. For this reason, this paper proposes a novel SVM classifier using Chebyshev distance to measure the empirical risk and designs an efficient iterative algorithm, named L{$\infty~$}-~BSVM in short. L{$\infty~$}-~BSVM includes the following merits: (1) it allows all sample points to participate in learning to prompt classification performance, especially in the case where the size of labeled data is small; (2) it minimizes the distance of the sample points that are (outliers in Non-i.i.d) farthest from the hyper-plane, where outliers are sufficiently taken into consideration (3) our iterative algorithm can solve large scale optimization problem with low time complexity and ensure the convergence of the optimum solution. Finally, extensive experiments on three types of datasets: artificial Non-i.i.d datasets, fault diagnosis of railway turnout with few labeled data (abnormal turnout) and six benchmark real-world datasets verify above opinions again and demonstrate that our classifier is much better than state-of-the-art competitors, such as B-SVM, LUHC, Pulce, B-LSSVM, NB and so on.}

  abstract = {A new approach for data-based stochastic parametrization of unresolved scales and processes in numerical weather and climate prediction models is introduced. The subgrid-scale model is conditional on the state of the resolved scales, consisting of a collection of local models. A clustering algorithm in the space of the resolved variables is combined with statistical modelling of the impact of the unresolved variables. The clusters and the parameters of the associated subgrid models are estimated simultaneously from data. The method is implemented and explored in the framework of the Lorenz '96 model using discrete Markov processes as local statistical models. Performance of the cluster-weighted Markov chain scheme is investigated for long-term simulations as well as ensemble prediction. It clearly outperforms simple parametrization schemes and compares favourably with another recently proposed subgrid modelling scheme also based on conditional Markov chains.},

  abstract = {Machine learning-based weather forecasting models have quickly emerged as a promising methodology for accurate medium-range global weather forecasting. Here, we introduce the Artificial Intelligence Forecasting System (AIFS), a data driven forecast model developed by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). AIFS is based on a graph neural network (GNN) encoder and decoder, and a sliding window transformer processor, and is trained on ECMWF's ERA5 re-analysis and ECMWF's operational numerical weather prediction (NWP) analyses. It has a flexible and modular design and supports several levels of parallelism to enable training on high-resolution input data. AIFS forecast skill is assessed by comparing its forecasts to NWP analyses and direct observational data. We show that AIFS produces highly skilled forecasts for upper-air variables, surface weather parameters and tropical cyclone tracks. AIFS is run four times daily alongside ECMWF's physics-based NWP model and forecasts are available to the public under ECMWF's open data policy.},

  abstract = {Abstract             DeepONets have recently been proposed as a framework for learning nonlinear operators mapping between infinite-dimensional Banach spaces. We analyze DeepONets and prove estimates on the resulting approximation and generalization errors. In particular, we extend the universal approximation property of DeepONets to include measurable mappings in non-compact spaces. By a decomposition of the error into encoding, approximation and reconstruction errors, we prove both lower and upper bounds on the total error, relating it to the spectral decay properties of the covariance operators, associated with the underlying measures. We derive almost optimal error bounds with very general affine reconstructors and with random sensor locations as well as bounds on the generalization error, using covering number arguments. We illustrate our general framework with four prototypical examples of nonlinear operators, namely those arising in a nonlinear forced ordinary differential equation, an elliptic partial differential equation (PDE) with variable coefficients and nonlinear parabolic and hyperbolic PDEs. While the approximation of arbitrary Lipschitz operators by DeepONets to accuracy \$\textbackslash epsilon \$ is argued to suffer from a `curse of dimensionality' (requiring a neural networks of exponential size in \$1/\textbackslash epsilon \$), in contrast, for all the above concrete examples of interest, we rigorously prove that DeepONets can break this curse of dimensionality (achieving accuracy \$\textbackslash epsilon \$ with neural networks of size that can grow algebraically in \$1/\textbackslash epsilon \$).Thus, we demonstrate the efficient approximation of a potentially large class of operators with this machine learning framework.},

  abstract = {Differential equations (DEs) are used as numerical models to describe physical phenomena throughout the field of engineering and science, including heat and fluid flow, structural bending, and systems dynamics. While there are many other techniques for finding approximate solutions to these equations, this paper looks to compare the application of the Theory of Functional Connections (TFC) with one based on least-squares support vector machines (LS-SVM). The TFC method uses a constrained expression, an expression that always satisfies the DE constraints, which transforms the process of solving a DE into solving an unconstrained optimization problem that is ultimately solved via least-squares (LS). In addition to individual analysis, the two methods are merged into a new methodology, called constrained SVMs (CSVM), by incorporating the LS-SVM method into the TFC framework to solve unconstrained problems. Numerical tests are conducted on four sample problems: One first order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE), one first order nonlinear ODE, one second order linear ODE, and one two-dimensional linear partial differential equation (PDE). Using the LS-SVM method as a benchmark, a speed comparison is made for all the problems by timing the training period, and an accuracy comparison is made using the maximum error and mean squared error on the training and test sets. In general, TFC is shown to be slightly faster (by an order of magnitude or less) and more accurate (by multiple orders of magnitude) than the LS-SVM and CSVM approaches.},

  abstract = {This paper aims to estimate short-term transportation demand fluctuations because of events such as meteorological events, major activities, and subway service disruptions. Four different modes are analyzed and compared, being bikesharing, taxi, subway, and bus. Case study includes 3\,years of transactional data on working days collected in Montreal, Canada. Generalized additive models (GAM) are developed for every mode. The dependent variable is the hourly number of trip departures from one subway station neighborhood. Independent variables are data from various events. Different models are calibrated for every subway station neighborhood to better understand spatial differences. Also, performance of GAM and autoregressive integrated moving average models are compared for prediction on different horizons. Results suggest that presence of rain decreases bikesharing, subway, and bus demand, while increasing taxi demand. In fact, after four consecutive hours of rain, bikesharing demand decreases by 28.0\%, subway and bus demand decreases by 4.6\%, while taxi increases by 13.9\%. Wind is only found significant for bikesharing. Temperature is found significant for all four modes but has a larger effect on bikesharing and taxi. Moreover, demand increases significantly during subway service disruptions for the three alternative modes studied, especially for taxi, suggesting an increase in demand of 182\% during disruptions of 1\,h. Furthermore, activities influence demand for all four modes, but subway seems to be the most affected one. This method allows for a better understanding of travel behaviors and makes it possible to consider a more dynamic adaptation of the transportation service supply to match travel demand based on various events. This could lead to better co-planning of events and transportation service, for example by temporarily increasing subway frequency or changing the position of some bikesharing stations.},

We explore the inclusion of predictors such as the yield curve, its latent factors, and a set of macroeconomic variables in order to increase the level of forecasting accuracy. The predictions result to be improved only when considering long forecast horizons. The use of machine learning algorithm provides additional guidance for data-driven decision making.}

  abstract = {Climate change is a global threat to the food and nutritional security of the world. As greenhouse-gas emissions in the atmosphere are increasing, the temperature is also rising due to the greenhouse effect. The average global temperature is increasing continuously and is predicted to rise by 2 {$^\circ$}C until 2100, which would cause substantial economic losses at the global level. The concentration of CO2, which accounts for a major proportion of greenhouse gases, is increasing at an alarming rate, and has led to higher growth and plant productivity due to increased photosynthesis, but increased temperature offsets this effect as it leads to increased crop respiration rate and evapotranspiration, higher pest infestation, a shift in weed flora, and reduced crop duration. Climate change also affects the microbial population and their enzymatic activities in soil. This paper reviews the information collected through the literature regarding the issue of climate change, its possible causes, its projection in the near future, its impact on the agriculture sector as an influence on physiological and metabolic activities of plants, and its potential and reported implications for growth and plant productivity, pest infestation, and mitigation strategies and their economic impact.},

  abstract = {The continuous partial differential equations governing a given physical phenomenon, such as the Navier--Stokes equations describing the fluid motion, must be numerically discretized in space and time in order to obtain a solution otherwise not readily available in closed (i.e., analytic) form. While the overall numerical discretization plays an essential role in the algorithmic efficiency and physically-faithful representation of the solution, the time-integration strategy commonly is one of the main drivers in terms of cost-to-solution (e.g., time- or energy-to-solution), accuracy and numerical stability, thus constituting one of the key building blocks of the computational model. This is especially true in time-critical applications, including numerical weather prediction (NWP), climate simulations and engineering. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the existing and emerging time-integration (also referred to as time-stepping) practices used in the operational global NWP and climate industry, where global refers to weather and climate simulations performed on the entire globe. While there are many flavors of time-integration strategies, in this review we focus on the most widely adopted in NWP and climate centers and we emphasize the reasons why such numerical solutions were adopted.This allows us to make some considerations on future trends in the field such as the need to balance accuracy in time with substantially enhanced time-to-solution and associated implications on energy consumption and running costs. In addition, the potential for the co-design of time-stepping algorithms and underlying high performance computing hardware, a keystone to accelerate the computational performance of future NWP and climate services, is also discussed in the context of the demanding operational requirements of the weather and climate industry.},

However, their applicability and effectiveness depend crucially on the choice of basis functions used to expand the solution of a PDE. The last decade has seen the emergence of deep learning as a strong contender in providing efficient representations of complex functions. In the current work, we present an approach for combining deep neural networks with spectral methods to solve PDEs. In particular, we use a deep learning technique known as the Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) to identify candidate functions on which to expand the solution of PDEs. We have devised an approach that uses the candidate functions provided by the DeepONet as a starting point to construct a set of functions that have the following properties: (1) they constitute a basis, (2) they are orthonormal, and (3) they are hierarchical, i.e., akin to Fourier series or orthogonal polynomials. We have exploited the favorable properties of our custom-made basis functions to both study their approximation capability and use them to expand the solution of linear and nonlinear time-dependent PDEs. The proposed approach advances the state of the art and versatility of spectral methods and, more generally, promotes the synergy between traditional scientific computing and machine learning.},

  abstract = {Although weather is known to impact consumer behavior and, accordingly, businesses react to weather-influenced consumer behavior, marketing scholars have not examined weather marketing as intensively as its practical importance suggests. To fill this research void, we choose the grocery shopping setting, where weather influences shoppers' shopping trip incidence and basket size. We theorize that the weather event (i.e., rain, snow, thunder, and fog) decreases both the shopping trip and the basket size. On the shopping trip, however, the negative weather impact is mitigated for less frequent shoppers because such shoppers have a higher basic shopping need than more frequent shoppers. Similarly, in terms of the basket size, store familiarity lessens such a negative weather impact because shoppers in a familiar environment are more comfortable about unfavorable weather. Besides, when sustained bad weather is expected, shoppers may turn proactive in determining when to go shopping. Our empirical application combines rich scanner panel data and daily weather data to explain both shopping trip and basket size simultaneously in the form of a Type 2 Tobit model. Our analysis results support our weather marketing hypotheses.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY             Full-waveform inversion (FWI) is the current standard method to determine final and detailed model parameters to be used in the seismic imaging process. However, FWI is an ill-posed problem that easily achieves a local minimum, leading the model solution in the wrong direction. Recently, some works proposed integrating FWI with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). In this case, the CNN weights are updated following the FWI gradient, defining the process as a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN). FWI integrated with CNN has an important advantage. The CNN stabilizes the inversion, acting like a regularizer, avoiding local minima-related problems and sparing an initial velocity model in some cases. However, such a process, especially when not requiring an initial model, is computationally expensive due to the high number of iterations required until the convergence. In this work, we propose an approach which relies on combining supervised learning and physics-informed by using a previously trained CNN to start the DL-FWI inversion. Loading the pre-trained weights configures transfer learning. The pre-trained CNN is obtained using a supervised approach based on training with a reduced and simple data set to capture the main velocity trend at the initial FWI iterations. The proposed training process is different from the initial works on the area which obtained the velocity model from the shots in supervised learning tasks and that required a large amount of labelled data to ensure reasonable model predictions. We investigated in our approach two CNN architectures, obtaining more robust results and a reduced number of parameters when using a modified U-Net. The method was probed over three benchmark models, showing consistently that the pre-training phase reduces the process's uncertainties and accelerates the model convergence using minimal prior information. Besides, the final scores of the iterative process are better than the examples without transfer learning. Thus, transfer learning solved one main limitation of the previous PINN approaches: the unfeasible number of iterations when not using an initial model. Moreover, we tested the method using data with low-frequency band limitations, since the lack of low frequencies is a common issue within real seismic data. The inversion converges to reasonable results probing the method's robustness with restricted frequency content.},

Handling large scale dataset of sensory events on real time to enable efficient interventions is challenging and very difficult. To deal with these data flows and challenges, traditional streaming data classification approaches can be boosted by use of incremental learning. In this paper, we presented two new Incremental SVM methods to improve the performance of SVM classification in the context of human activity recognition tasks. Two feature extraction methods elaborated by refining dependency sensor extraction feature and focusing on the last sensor event only have been suggested. On the other hand, a clustering based approach and a similarity based approach have been suggested to boost learning performance of the incremental SVM algorithms capitalizing on the relationship between data chunk and support vectors of previous chunk. We demonstrate through several simulations on two major publicly available data sets (Aruba and Tulum), the feasibility and improvements in learning and classification performances in real time achieved by our proposed methods over the state-of-the-art. For instance, we have shown that the introduced similarity-based incremental learning is 5 to 9 times faster than other methods in terms of training performances. Similarly, the introduced Last-state sensor feature method induces at least 5\% improvement in terms of F1-score when using baseline SVM classifier.},

  abstract = {As a structural health monitoring (SHM) system can hardly measure all the needed responses, estimating the target response from the measured responses has become an important task. Deep neural networks (NNs) have a strong nonlinear mapping ability, and they are widely used in response reconstruction works. The mapping relation among different responses is learned by a NN given a large training set. In some cases, however, especially for rare events such as earthquakes, it is difficult to obtain a large training dataset. This paper used a convolution NN to reconstruct structure response under rare events with small datasets, and the main innovations include two aspects. Firstly, we proposed a multi-end autoencoder architecture with skip connections, which compresses the parameter space, to estimate the unmeasured responses. It extracts the shared patterns in the encoder and reconstructs different types of target responses in varied branches of the decoder. Secondly, the physics-based loss function, derived from the dynamic equilibrium equation, was adopted to guide the training direction and suppress the overfitting effect. The proposed NN takes the acceleration at limited positions as input. The output is the displacement, velocity, and acceleration responses at all positions. Two numerical studies validated that the proposed framework applies to both linear and nonlinear systems. The physics-informed NN had a higher performance than the ordinary NN with small datasets, especially when the training data contained noise.},

In               F               inland, locally applied accuracy measures indicate marked improvements in the quality of forecasts for the general public since the late 1980s. It is assumed that similar trends will continue to the foreseeable future. Use of weather information will allow for better options in the decision-making of various stake holders in the transport sector, such as commuters or tourists, transport infrastructure owners and transport service and maintenance operators. This paper discusses the economic impacts and value of weather forecasts on different transport modes (road, rail, air) highlighting the effects of potential improvements in forecast quality in the expected future climates in               E               urope. It is not only the improved quality of available weather forecasts that will define the value of information. The way in which the information is communicated and how it is being utilized by decision-makers are highly relevant steps in a weather service value chain.

  abstract = {Shaft alignment prediction is essential for the development of effective coupling and rotating equipment maintenance systems. In this paper, we present a modified support vector regression (SVR) approach for shaft alignment predictions based on fast Fourier transform generated spectra data. The modified SVR approach uses data-dependent parameters in order to reduce computation time and achieve better predictions. The spectra data used is characterized by a large number of descriptors and very few data points. The strengths of SVR for shaft misalignment prediction include its ability to represent data in high-dimensional space through kernel functions. We reduce the dimension of the data using a multivariate AIC criterion in order to guarantee that the selected spectra are response dependent. We compare the performance of SVR with two of the most popular techniques used in condition monitoring, partial least squares, and principal components regression. Our results show that we can improve the performance of shaft misalignment prediction using SVR and the approach compares very favorably with partial least squares and principal components regression approaches. Also, we present a quantitative measure, shaft misalignment monitoring index, which can be used to facilitate easy identification of the alignment condition and as input to maintenance systems design.},

  abstract = {Model selection is critical to least squares support vector machine (LSSVM). A major problem of existing model selection approaches of LSSVM is that the inverse of the kernel matrix need to be calculated with O(n\textasciicircum 3) complexity for each iteration, where n is the number of training examples. It is prohibitive for the large scale application. In this paper, we propose an approximate approach to model selection of LSSVM. We use multilevel circulant matrices to approximate the kernel matrix so that the fast Fourier transform (FFT) can be applied to reduce the computational cost of matrix inverse. With such approximation, we first design an efficient LSSVM algorithm with O(nlog(n)) complexity and theoretically analyze the effect of kernel matrix approximation on the decision function of LSSVM. We further show that the approximate optimal model produced with the multilevel circulant matrix is consistent with the accurate one produced with the original kernel matrix. Under the guarantee of consistency, we present an approximate model selection scheme, whose complexity is significantly lower than the previous approaches. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of approximate model selection.}

  abstract = {We introduce a deep, generative autoencoder capable of learning hierarchies of distributed representations from data. Successive deep stochastic hidden layers are equipped with autoregressive connections, which enable the model to be sampled from quickly and exactly via ancestral sampling. We derive an efficient approximate parameter estimation method based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle, which can be seen as maximising a variational lower bound on the log-likelihood, with a feedforward neural network implementing approximate inference. We demonstrate state-of-the-art generative performance on a number of classic data sets: several UCI data sets, MNIST and Atari 2600 games.}

  abstract = {Partial differential equations (PDEs) play a prominent role in many disciplines of science and engineering. PDEs are commonly derived based on empirical observations. However, with the rapid development of sensors, computational power, and data storage in the past decade, huge quantities of data can be easily collected and efficiently stored. Such vast quantity of data offers new opportunities for data-driven discovery of physical laws. Inspired by the latest development of neural network designs in deep learning, we propose a new feed-forward deep network, called PDE-Net, to fulfill two objectives at the same time: to accurately predict dynamics of complex systems and to uncover the underlying hidden PDE models. Comparing with existing approaches, our approach has the most flexibility by learning both differential operators and the nonlinear response function of the underlying PDE model. A special feature of the proposed PDE-Net is that all filters are properly constrained, which enables us to easily identify the governing PDE models while still maintaining the expressive and predictive power of the network. These constrains are carefully designed by fully exploiting the relation between the orders of differential operators and the orders of sum rules of filters (an important concept originated from wavelet theory). Numerical experiments show that the PDE-Net has the potential to uncover the hidden PDE of the observed dynamics, and predict the dynamical behavior for a relatively long time, even in a noisy environment.}

  abstract = {In mountainous landscapes, the diverse geotechnical conditions amplify landslide susceptibility. Factors such as precipitation and seismic activity can trigger landslides, while inherent hazards such as voids, fissures, and compaction deficits jeopardize long-term slope stability. Detecting and forecasting these susceptibilities accurately is crucial. In this paper, the time-domain finite-difference approach and the gprMax software are used to conduct forward modeling of landslide susceptibility. An electrical model of subsurface aqueous structures is created, including water-filled and air-filled cavities, fracture zones, and fault lines. The distinctive radar signal responses within these environments are examined, and a dataset of B-scan images associated with their electrical models is constructed. By employing deep learning algorithms and the robust nonlinear mapping ability of convolutional neural networks in the Pix2Pix generative adversarial network, we accelerate the intelligent inversion of the geological radar data on landslide susceptibility. This innovative approach effectively reconstructs hazard models, offering a reliable basis for interpretation of radar signals.}

We compare gradient-based optimizers Adam, L-BFGS, and their combination Adam+L-BFGS, showing the superiority of Adam+L-BFGS, and introduce a novel second-order optimizer, NysNewton-CG (NNCG), which significantly improves PINN performance. Theoretically, our work elucidates the connection between ill-conditioned differential operators and ill-conditioning in the PINN loss and shows the benefits of combining first- and second-order optimization methods. Our work presents valuable insights and more powerful optimization strategies for training PINNs, which could improve the utility of PINNs for solving difficult partial differential equations.},

These include space transportation, in-space manufacturing, bioproduction, in-space agriculture, nuclear launch, and propulsion systems, as well as satellite services and their maintenance. However, the current nature of space as an open-access resource and global commons presents a systemic risk for exuberant competition for space goods and services, which may result in a ``tragedy of the commons'' dilemma. In the race among countries to capture the value of space exploration, NASA, American research universities, and private companies can avoid any coordination failures by collaborating in a public--private research and development partnership (PPRDP) structure. We present such a structure founded upon the principles of polycentric autonomous governance, which incorporate a decentralized autonomous organization framework and specialized research clusters. By advancing an alignment of incentives among the specified participatory members, PPRDPs can play a pivotal role in stimulating open-source research by creating positive knowledge spillover effects and agglomeration externalities as well as embracing the nonlinear decomposition paradigm that may blur the distinction between basic and applied research.},

  abstract = {Following the 2013 Chelyabinsk event, the risks posed by asteroids attracted renewed interest, from both the scientific and policy-making communities. It reminded the world that impacts from near-Earth objects (NEOs), while rare, have the potential to cause great damage to cities and populations. Point estimates of the risk (such as mean numbers of casualties) have been proposed, but because of the low-probability, high-consequence nature of asteroid impacts, these averages provide limited actionable information. While more work is needed to further refine its input distributions (e.g., NEO diameters), the probabilistic model presented in this article allows a more complete evaluation of the risk of NEO impacts because the results are distributions that cover the range of potential casualties. This model is based on a modularized simulation that uses probabilistic inputs to estimate probabilistic risk metrics, including those of rare asteroid impacts. Illustrative results of this analysis are presented for a period of 100 years. As part of this demonstration, we assess the effectiveness of civil defense measures in mitigating the risk of human casualties. We find that they are likely to be beneficial but not a panacea. We also compute the probability---but not the consequences---of an impact with global effects (``cataclysm''). We conclude that there is a continued need for NEO observation, and for analyses of the feasibility and risk-reduction effectiveness of space missions designed to deflect or destroy asteroids that threaten the Earth.},

  abstract = {Direct observations of earthquake nucleation and propagation are few and yet the next decade will likely see an unprecedented increase in indirect, surface observations that must be integrated into modeling efforts. Machine learning (ML) excels in the presence of large data and is an actively growing field in seismology. However, not all ML methods incorporate rigorous physics, and purely data-driven models can predict physically unrealistic outcomes due to observational bias or extrapolation. Our work focuses on the recently emergent Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), which seamlessly integrates data while ensuring that model outcomes satisfy rigorous physical constraints. In this work we develop a multi-network PINN for both the forward problem as well as for direct inversion of nonlinear fault friction parameters, constrained by the physics of motion in the solid Earth, which have direct implications for assessing seismic hazard. We present the computational PINN framework for strike-slip faults in 1D and 2D subject to rate-and-state friction. Initial and boundary conditions define the data on which the PINN is trained. While the PINN is capable of approximating the solution to the governing equations to low-errors, our primary interest lies in the network's capacity to infer friction parameters during the training loop. We find that the network for the parameter inversion at the fault performs much better than the network for material displacements to which it is coupled. Additional training iterations and model tuning resolves this discrepancy, enabling a robust surrogate model for solving both forward and inverse problems relevant to seismic faulting.},

The most advanced of these systems explicitly and quantitatively model the impacts of hazards on affected assets or infrastructure such as vehicle traffic or housing. Incorporating impact information into severe weather warnings contextualises and personalises the warning information, increasing the likelihood that individuals and communities will take preparatory action.

However, the optimization of these networks has become more difficult as neural networks going deeper and datasets becoming bigger. Therefore, more advanced optimization algorithms have been proposed over the past years. In this study, widely used optimization algorithms for deep learning are examined in detail. To this end, these algorithms called adaptive gradient methods are implemented for both supervised and unsupervised tasks. The behavior of the algorithms during training and results on four image datasets, namely, MNIST, CIFAR-10, Kaggle Flowers and Labeled Faces in the Wild are compared by pointing out their differences against basic optimization algorithms.},

  abstract = {Extreme weather and climate-related events occur in a particular place, by definition, infrequently. It is therefore challenging to detect systematic changes in their occurrence given the relative shortness of observational records. However, there is a clear interest from outside the climate science community in the extent to which recent damaging extreme events can be linked to human-induced climate change or natural climate variability. Event attribution studies seek to determine to what extent anthropogenic climate change has altered the probability or magnitude of particular events. They have shown clear evidence for human influence having increased the probability of many extremely warm seasonal temperatures and reduced the probability of extremely cold seasonal temperatures in many parts of the world. The evidence for human influence on the probability of extreme precipitation events, droughts, and storms is more mixed. Although the science of event attribution has developed rapidly in recent years, geographical coverage of events remains patchy and based on the interests and capabilities of individual research groups. The development of operational event attribution would allow a more timely and methodical production of attribution assessments than currently obtained on an ad hoc basis. For event attribution assessments to be most useful, remaining scientific uncertainties need to be robustly assessed and the results clearly communicated. This requires the continuing development of methodologies to assess the reliability of event attribution results and further work to understand the potential utility of event attribution for stakeholder groups and decision makers.

Taking the case of population dynamics, I point out that there are several very general law-like propositions that provide the theoretical basis for most population dynamics models that were developed to address specific issues. Some of these foundational principles, like the law of exponential growth, are logically very similar to certain laws of physics (Newton's law of inertia, for example, is almost a direct analogue of exponential growth). I discuss two other principles (population self-limitation and resource-consumer oscillations), as well as the more elementary postulates that underlie them. None of the ``laws'' that I propose for population ecology are new. Collectively ecologists have been using these general principles in guiding development of their models and experiments since the days of Lotka, Volterra, and Gause.},

  abstract = {Full waveform inversion (FWI) is a high-resolution seismic imaging technique that is based on using the entire content of seismic traces for extracting physical parameters of the medium sampled by seismic waves. The widespread strategy of seismic imaging, the single scattering formulation, at the core of FWI, assumes no prior scale in the model description. Each unexplained residual data sample at receivers for one source is assumed to come from any point of the medium, and only the summation over sources and receivers helps in locating medium property anomalies, regardless of what type of phase is involved. This pixel-oriented perturbation leads to the local optimization approach, which is a linearized differential approach based on the Newton equation. For a least-squares misfit function, there are both the gradient vector and Hessian matrix, in addition to approximations that can be considered for the related Newton equation. The forward problem of the wave propagation, used thousands of times during optimization, should be efficient, and these equations are expressed either as a first-order hyperbolic system of velocity-stress or as a second-order hyperbolic system of displacement (or velocity) only, by using a self-adjoint formulation in both cases. Gradient vectors are built as a zero-lag crosscorrelation in time between incident and adjoint wavefields with forward and backward patterns and also could be used for obtaining Hessian-matrix approximations. Resolution and uncertainties are relevant, although the actual state of the art does not provide meaningful estimation of these quantities: the FWI remains a deterministic approach at this time. An examplary North Sea data set from the Valhall reservoir illustrates the successful story for high-resolution imaging based on data-driven components, with paleorivers stored in sediments, imprints of glaciers in the bedrock, and gas clouds at different scales in the image. Alternative sources of information on the medium, such as sonic logs and geologic interpretation, are illustrated through a model-driven component of the misfit function. Although methods can be used to increase the speed of the workflow, they are quite costly. The multiparameter reconstruction, which is mandatory for elastic FWI, starts to be feasible if one improves the Hessian-matrix influence. Thus, FWI is becoming a mature strategy for high-resolution seismic imaging.}

  abstract = {Full-waveform inversion (FWI) is a challenging data-fitting procedure based on full-wavefield modeling to extract quantitative information from seismograms. High-resolution imaging at half the propagated wavelength is expected. Recent advances in high-performance computing and multifold/multicomponent wide-aperture and wide-azimuth acquisitions make 3D acoustic FWI feasible today. Key ingredients of FWI are an efficient forward-modeling engine and a local differential approach, in which the gradient and the Hessian operators are efficiently estimated. Local optimization does not, however, prevent convergence of the misfit function toward local minima because of the limited accuracy of the starting model, the lack of low frequencies, the presence of noise, and the approximate modeling of thewave-physics complexity. Different hierarchical multiscale strategies are designed to mitigate the nonlinearity and ill-posedness of FWI by incorporating progressively shorter wavelengths in the parameter space. Synthetic and real-data case studies address reconstructing various parameters, from [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] velocities to density, anisotropy, and attenuation. This review attempts to illuminate the state of the art of FWI. Crucial jumps, however, remain necessary to make it as popular as migration techniques. The challenges can be categorized as (1) building accurate starting models with automatic procedures and/or recording low frequencies, (2) defining new minimization criteria to mitigate the sensitivity of FWI to amplitude errors and increasing the robustness of FWI when multiple parameter classes are estimated, and (3) improving computational efficiency by data-compression techniques to make 3D elastic FWI feasible.},

  abstract = {Efficiency impacts can be assessed based on improvements in accessibility promoted by the high-speed rail (HSR) project, focusing mainly on major urban areas. Spatial equity impacts originate from changes in the distribution of accessibility levels observed across such cities. This study uses the weighted average travel time and coefficient of variation to explore the impact of HSR on efficiency and spatial equity within the Central Plains Economic Region (CPER) and to build an ``efficiency-equity'' model to identify optimal upgrading of conventional rail (CR) lines to improve the accessibility of the CPER and mitigate regional disparities. The results indicate that since the operation of HSR, accessibility levels across the CPER have improved by roughly 24.56\%, and the spatial distribution of gains has been uneven since the most significant improvements have occurred in HSR cities and large cities. Inequality in regional accessibility has increased by 28.12\%, creating a more heterogeneous pattern of accessibility. With goals of ``efficiency'' and ``equity'', an examination of the upgrading of CR as an approach shows that ``Xinxiang-Jiaozuo'' and ``Xinxiang-Jiaozuo-Sanmenxia-Yuncheng'' are the best upgraded lines for improving the efficiency of the CPER and limiting regional disparities. The results of this study serve as supportive information for the planning and construction of HSR lines and networks and for underdeveloped regional transport system policymaking.},

  abstract = {Design and optimal control problems are among the fundamental, ubiquitous tasks we face in science and engineering. In both cases, we aim to represent and optimize an unknown (black-box) function that associates a performance/outcome to a set of controllable variables through an experiment. In cases where the experimental dynamics can be described by partial differential equations (PDEs), such problems can be mathematically translated into PDE-constrained optimization tasks, which quickly become intractable as the number of control variables and the cost of experiments increases. In this work we leverage physics-informed deep operator networks (DeepONets) -- a self-supervised framework for learning the solution operator of parametric PDEs -- to build fast and differentiable surrogates for rapidly solving PDE-constrained optimization problems, even in the absence of any paired input-output training data. The effectiveness of the proposed framework will be demonstrated across different applications involving continuous functions as control or design variables, including time-dependent optimal control of heat transfer, and drag minimization of obstacles in Stokes flow. In all cases, we observe that DeepONets can minimize high-dimensional cost functionals in a matter of seconds, yielding a significant speed up compared to traditional adjoint PDE solvers that are typically costly and limited to relatively low-dimensional control/design parametrizations.},

  abstract = {Enabling the rapid emulation of parametric differential equations with physics-informed deep operator networks.           ,              Partial differential equations (PDEs) play a central role in the mathematical analysis and modeling of complex dynamic processes across all corners of science and engineering. Their solution often requires laborious analytical or computational tools, associated with a cost that is markedly amplified when different scenarios need to be investigated, for example, corresponding to different initial or boundary conditions, different inputs, etc. In this work, we introduce physics-informed DeepONets, a deep learning framework for learning the solution operator of arbitrary PDEs, even in the absence of any paired input-output training data. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in rapidly predicting the solution of various types of parametric PDEs up to three orders of magnitude faster compared to conventional PDE solvers, setting a previously unexplored paradigm for modeling and simulation of nonlinear and nonequilibrium processes in science and engineering.},

  abstract = {To predict the multi-point vibration response in the frequency domain when the uncorrelated multi-source loads are unknown, a data-driven and multi-input multi-output least squares support vector regression (MIMO LS-SVR)-based method in the frequency domain is proposed. Firstly, the relationship between the measured multi-point vibration response and unmeasured multi-point vibration response is formulated using the transfer function in the frequency domain. Secondly, the data-driven multiple regression analysis problem of multi-point vibration response prediction in the frequency domain is described formally, and its mathematical model is established. With the measured multi-point vibration response as the input and the unmeasured multi-point vibration response as the output, the vibration response history data are assembled as a MIMO training dataset at each frequency. Thirdly, using the MIMO LS-SVR algorithm and MIMO history training dataset, the multi-point vibration response prediction model is built at each frequency point. By comparing the transmissibility matrix method, multiple linear regression model-based method, and MIMO neural network method, the application scope of the proposed method and its advantages are analyzed. The experimental results for acoustic and vibration experiment on a cylindrical shell verified that the MIMO LS-SVR-based method predicts the multi-point vibration response effectively when the loads are unknown, and has higher precision than the transfer function method, multiple linear regression method, MIMO neural network method, and transmissibility matrix method.},

  abstract = {There is currently a wave of high speed rail proposals sweeping through Europe, amounting to some 7000 route kilometres of new construction and 8000 of upgraded track and costing of the order of 58 billion ecu (in 1985 prices). There is therefore an urgent need for a careful assessment of the costs and benefits, both of the network as a whole and of the individual component parts of it. The principal benefits of high speed rail are taken to be the revenue, traffic and time savings it generates; relief of congestion , accidents and environmental effects of other modes of transport and its alleged local and regional development benefits. Clearly many of these benefits depend on how far it really does divert traffic from these modes as opposed to generating totally new trips. At the same time, high speed rail schemes have significant environmental costs. Evidence on all of these issues is examined, and it is concluded that the evidence for environmental and development benefits is limited, although in the former case in particular much depends on the exact circumstances. Given the wide variety of options in terms of speeds and mix of upgrading versus new construction, careful appraisal is very important, and a traditional transport cost-benefit analysis and environmental impact assessment appear well equipped to capture the main costs and benefits. The conclusion is that there is likely to be a good case for a core network linking the major cities of Western Europe in the middle distance range, but beyond that, upgrading of existing infrastructure and development of new technology may provide a more cost-effective solution.}

  abstract = {Ultrasonic methods have been extensively developed in nondestructive testing for various materials and components. However, accurately extracting quantitative information about defects still remains challenging, especially for complex structures. Although the immersion technique is commonly used for complex-shaped parts, the large mismatch of acoustic impedance between water and metal prevents effective ultrasonic transmission and leads to a low signal-to-noise ratio(SNR). In this paper, a quantitative imaging method is proposed for complex-shaped parts based on an ice-coupled full waveform inversion (FWI) method. Numerical experiments were carried out to quantitatively inspect the various defects in a turbine blade. Firstly, the k-space pseudospectral method was applied to simulate ice-coupled ultrasonic testing for the turbine blade. The recorded full wavefields were then applied for a frequency-domain FWI based on the Limited-memory Broyden--Fletcher--Goldfarb--Shanno (L-BFGS) method. With a carefully selected iterative number and frequency, a successive-frequency FWI can well detect half wavelength defects. Extended studies on an open notch with different orientations and multiple adjacent defects proved its capability to detect different types of defects. Finally, an uncertainty analysis was conducted with inaccurate initial velocity models with a relative error of \textpm 2\%, demonstrating its robustness even with a certain inaccuracy. This study demonstrates that the proposed method has a high potential to inspect complex-shaped structures with an excellent resolution.},
