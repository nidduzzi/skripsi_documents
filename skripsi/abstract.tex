\noindent Numerical models of systems are a crucial part of science and engineering. The use of machine learning in this space for operator learning provides an alternative as data-driven surrogates. The Fourier Transform provides a key component for learning the relationship between a function and its derivatives. Building on Spectral Neural Operators (SNO), we propose a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based framework to learn the underlying governing equations of a system based on data. We study the viability and interpretability of the proposed framework on the derivative equation and the Burgers' equation. The model is able to learn from mathematically correct random data and is able to partially generalize to an exact solution of the Burgers' equation. The learned model is interpreted and verified to have learned the correct contributions of the input function coefficients to the output function coefficients.
